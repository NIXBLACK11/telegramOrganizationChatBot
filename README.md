# Telegram NLP Chat Bot

The Telegram NLP chat bot is designed to understand and respond to natural language input from users on the Telegram platform. It uses NLP to analyze the user's message and determine what action should be taken in response. For example, if the user asks for the weather in a certain location, the bot will use an NLP model to extract the location and then retrieve weather information using an API.

To store data related to user conversations and other information, the bot uses MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, which makes it well-suited for handling unstructured data like text messages.

Finally, the bot is Dockerized for easy deployment and management. Docker allows you to package your application along with all its dependencies into a single container, which can be deployed to any environment that supports Docker. This makes it easy to set up and manage the bot on different servers or cloud platforms without having to worry about dependencies or compatibility issues.

Overall, the combination of NLP, MongoDB, and Docker makes for a powerful and flexible chat bot that can be easily deployed and scaled to handle a large number of users and conversations.

## Problems solved by ChatBots
Furthermore, chatbots solve various problems across domains, including :
- Enhanced Customer Support: Chatbots improve customer support by providing quick and
accurate responses, handling FAQs, and troubleshooting common issues, resulting in
improved response times and customer satisfaction.
- 24/7 Availability: Unlike human agents, chatbots can operate round the clock, providing
continuous support and assistance to users, regardless of time zones.
- Time and Cost Efficiency: Chatbots automate routine tasks, handle multiple queries
simultaneously, and reduce the need for additional human resources, resulting in time and
cost savings for businesses.
- Personalized Recommendations: Chatbots analyze user preferences and behavior to offer
personalized recommendations, improving user engagement and conversion rates.
- Simplified Transactions: Chatbots facilitate seamless and user-friendly transactions by
processing payments, providing order details, and assisting with transaction-related
inquiries.
- Language Learning and Assistance: Chatbots serve as language tutors, offering language
learning resources, vocabulary exercises, and interactive conversational practice.
- Streamlined Information Retrieval: Chatbots excel at retrieving specific information
quickly and accurately, providing real-time data, weather updates, news summaries, and
access to FAQs.
- Increased User Engagement: Chatbots engage users in conversational experiences,
fostering personalized assistance and connection, leading to improved user engagement
and brand loyalty.
- Data Collection and Analysis: Chatbots gather valuable user data, enabling market
research, customer analysis, and product/service improvements.
- Workflow Automation: Chatbots automate internal workflows, handling administrative
tasks, scheduling meetings, retrieving information, and providing internal support,
optimizing operational processes.
By addressing these challenges, chatbots significantly contribute to improved customer
experiences, increased efficiency, and enhanced productivity across industries and sectors.

## Methodology
### Technologies used by CHATBANKER
When developing ChatBanker, I leveraged a variety of technologies to ensure its functionality
and effectiveness. Some of the key technologies utilized include:
#### NLP(Natural Language Processing)
NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and
human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a
meaningful way.
- In the context of Chatbanker, NLP is used to process and understand user inputs. It helps
extract relevant information and intents from the messages sent by users.
- NLP techniques often involve tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity
recognition, and sentiment analysis, among others. These techniques help analyze the
structure and meaning of user messages.
#### Mongo DB
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing
and retrieving data.
- In Chatbanker, MongoDB is used to store and manage various data related to user
accounts, such as account balances, transaction history, and other relevant information.
- You can create a MongoDB database and define collections to store different types of
data. Each document in a collection can represent a user account, containing fields like
account number, balance, and policies.
#### TELEGRAM API
The Telegram API allows Chatbanker to interact with users on the Telegram messaging platform.
It provides various methods and functionalities to send and receive messages, process user
inputs, and perform other actions within Telegram.
- To use the Telegram API, you need to create a Telegram bot by registering with the
BotFather, which is the official bot for creating and managing bots on Telegram. The
BotFather provides you with an API token that you can use to authenticate Chatbanker
and make API calls.
#### Amazon(EC2)
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a scalable virtual machine service provided by AWS. It
allows you to create and manage virtual servers, known as EC2 instances, in the cloud. These
instances serve as the infrastructure to host and run Chatbanker's backend server.
With EC2, you can choose the specifications for your virtual instances, including the CPU,
memory, storage, and operating system. This flexibility enables you to tailor the resources
according to the requirements of the Chatbanker application.
To deploy a chatbot on AWS EC2, follow these steps:
- Create an EC2 instance with the desired specifications.
- Set up the backend server by installing dependencies and deploying the code.

- Configure networking and security settings.
- Connect the chatbot to external services with the necessary credentials.
- Test the chatbot's functionality and set up monitoring.
- Scale the EC2 instances as needed and automate deployment for updates.
