The neural network architecture implemented in the provided program does not utilize a traditional bag-of-words representation. Instead, it directly processes the LASER-encoded input sentences as numerical vectors. Below is a revised section focusing solely on the neural network architecture:

#### Input Layer: LASER Encoded Vectors
The neural network starts with an input layer that directly processes the LASER-encoded input vectors. Each vector represents a fixed-length numerical representation of the input sentence, capturing semantic information efficiently. These encoded vectors serve as the input features for the neural network.

#### Hidden Layers: Feature Extraction
The input features are passed through two hidden layers, each comprising linear transformations followed by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. These hidden layers perform intricate feature extraction, capturing complex relationships and patterns present in the input data. Non-linearity introduced by the ReLU activation functions aids in representing intricate features effectively.

#### Output Layer: Intent Classification
At the output layer, the neural network determines the intent behind the user input through intent classification. The size of the output layer corresponds to the count of distinct intents present in the training data. Each neuron in this layer represents a potential intent, with the output logits indicating the confidence scores for each intent.

#### Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss
During training, the neural network utilizes the Cross-Entropy Loss function to measure the dissimilarity between the predicted intent probabilities and the actual intent labels in the training data. This loss function guides the model training process, facilitating convergence towards accurate intent classification.

#### Optimizer: Adam Optimizer
The project utilizes the Adam optimizer, renowned for its adaptive learning rate mechanism. The Adam optimizer adjusts learning rates based on gradient moments, ensuring efficient and stable convergence during model training.

## Methodology
### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline

The heart of this project lies in its NLP pipeline, which orchestrates a sequence of carefully designed steps to transform user input into meaningful responses. The pipeline leverages various NLP techniques and tools to ensure efficient comprehension and interaction.

#### Tokenization
![CHATBANKER](../Readme/tokenization.jpg)

Tokenization: User input sentences are initially tokenized, meaning they are divided into individual words or tokens. This process is facilitated by the NLTK library's nltk.word_tokenize() function. Tokenization dissects sentences into meaningful units, forming the basis for further analysis.

#### Stemming
![CHATBANKER](../Readme/stemming.jpg)

The pipeline employs stemming, using the Porter Stemmer algorithm (nltk.stem.porter.PorterStemmer), which identifies the root form of words. This process helps reduce variations of words to their base form, aiding in text normalization and pattern recognition.

#### Bag of Words Representation

The tokenized words from user input are then transformed into a numerical representation known as a "bag of words."
Each sentence is converted into a fixed-length numerical vector. This vector encodes the presence or absence of words, disregarding their order. The nltk_utils.bag_of_words() function computes this vector by marking the presence of words from the tokenized sentence in a predefined vocabulary.

### Neural Network Architecture

The foundation of this project is a specialized Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) architecture, meticulously crafted to excel in multi-class classification tasks. Built using the PyTorch framework, the network employs layers designed for powerful feature extraction and intent classification.

####  Layers and Components
Input Layer: Bag of Words:
The neural network commences with an input layer that processes bag of words vectors. Each vector encodes the presence of specific words from user input. The length of the vector corresponds to the vocabulary size derived from training data.
Hidden Layers: Feature Extraction

Two hidden layers, comprising linear transformations (nn.Linear) followed by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions (nn.ReLU), perform intricate feature extraction.
These hidden layers unravel complex relationships in the input data, harnessing non-linearity for enhanced understanding.
Output Layer: Intent Classification

The output layer's size mirrors the count of distinct intents (classes) present in the training data. Each neuron in this layer signifies a potential intent.
Logits generated by this layer gauge the network's intent confidence based on input data.

#### Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss (nn.CrossEntropyLoss)

The Cross-Entropy Loss serves as the guiding compass for model training, gauging the dissimilarity between predicted intent probabilities and actual intent labels in the training data.
#### Optimizer: Adam Optimizer (torch.optim.Adam)

The project harnesses the power of the Adam optimizer, known for its adaptive learning rate mechanism. By adjusting learning rates based on gradient moments, this optimizer ensures efficient and stable convergence.
